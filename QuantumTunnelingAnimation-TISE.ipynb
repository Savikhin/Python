This function repeatedly calls the _animate_ function defined just before FuncAnimation with just one argument - the counter i, which is incremented by 1 with each consequent call. The function _animate_ takes a new time argument from the array of times t[], and uses this time to calculate the wavefunction at t=t[i]. It then uses the newly calculated wf to set the line1, line2, and line3. The lines are replotted in the plot, and FuncAnimation saves the plot as a new frame of animation.\n",
